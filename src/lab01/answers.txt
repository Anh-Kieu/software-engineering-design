(2.1)
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over
time so that one can recall specific versions later.

(2.2)
Types of version control
- Local Version Control Systems: Simple cases, for individual work
- Centralized Version Control Systems: Access depends on how much authority one
is granted. For example, only the administer can look at everyone's work while
anyone lower might not have the access.
- Distributed Version Control Systems: All participants can access the data and
any version database can back up the server.

(2.3)
Git is Distributed Version Control Systems

(2.4)
Git performs operation locally means that the operations actually happens on the
local system instead of the big server, or any other computers.
Git's local operation makes the data more ready for use, thus making the data
processing faster. It also means you don't always need internet connection

(2.5)
Git uses SHA-1 hash: 40 character string composed of hexadecimal characters and
calculated based on the contents of the file or directory structure. It is
impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing.
As a result, Git knows where the file corrupt or where the info being lost in
transit.

(2.6)
A file can be in 3 states: modified, staged or committed. When a participant
makes change to the file from their repository, they are making modification in
 their own workspace (modified state). Then, they will choose some of the changes
they have made and decided to keep to put it into the staged area (staged state).
After that, the person does a commit, turning all the changes in the stage area
official (commit stage), pushing all those changes into their Git directory.

(2.7) A commit represents a snapshot of the changes I have made to my files in
my local repository.

(2.8) Git branches represents a diverge version from the main line of the deve-
lopment. Basically another version of the work I am doing, and I can modify that
without messing up my main, working code.

(5.1) Bytecodes are the machine language of JVM. They are generated through a
complier into a class files.

(5.2) JVM makes Java independent of the Operating System as the code is compiled
by the JVM not the OS itself. Basically the output will be the same throughout
different OS.

(5.3) Since the code has to be compiled by JVM first, it could be slower than
actually having the code running by the OS.

(5.4) It is generally true what they said about Java, but compared with Python,
its user-friendliness, readability or platform independent feature are repeated
and honestly Python has better readable syntax (in my opinion, not a fan of curly
bracket and ; even though indent sucks).

(5.5) Types of comment:
// this is for single line comment
/* ignore everything inside these symbols */
/** for documentation */

(5.6) Assume we are in the directory that contains MyProgram.java
javac MyProgram.java
java MyProgram

If packaged, supposed named lab01:
javac lab01/MyProgram.java
java lab01.MyProgram

(5.7) println(String x) prints a String and then terminate the line.

(5.8) in represents standard input stream. Its type is InputStream

(5.9) System.getProperties(os.name)

(7.1) ns ==> 1050533973369857

(7.2) ms ==> 1050533973

(7.3) Since java is statically-typed, the result of two integer typed variables
should also be an integer, which is 1 instead of 1.5.

(7.4) Since Java operates the x/y first, which results in an integer 1, the value
of the variable is actually 1, then since it is typed double, it converts the value
to double type.

(7.5) Answer = 1.579

(8.1) C++ could be said as the direct predecessor to Java. Their ancestor is C.

(8.2) JVM is a virtual machine that helps execute bytecode (output of a Java compiler).
Basically an interpreter for bytecode. JVM provides more security as it manages
program execution, making it possible for the JVM to create a restricted execution
environment. It blocks all the unwanted access to the machine.

(8.3) Bytecode is the output of a Java compiler. It is a highly optimized set of
 instructions that can only be executed by JVM.

(8.4) SE is Standard Edition

(8.5) JDK is Java Development Kit

(8.6) main is the method that Java program begins execution with.

(8.7) args receives command-line arguments when the program is executed

(8.8) void indicates no return value for this method. In a method declaration,
we always have to indicate the type of the return value.

(8.9) identifier is the name of the method, can be used to called somewhere else
along the program

(8.10) keywords in Java are the reserved words used by Java system. In other words,
keywords already have their functions, thus cannot be used to name variables.

(8.11) literal is a representation of a constant value.

(8.12) a block of code is a group of two or more statements between opening and
closing curly braces.
