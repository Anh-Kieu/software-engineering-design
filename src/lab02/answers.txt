(1.1) Primitive type in a programming language represents single values instead of objects,
which saves the language running time as it does not have to create different objects that
have the value, instead, just having that value straight up.

(1.2) Primitive types:
- byte
- short
- int
- long
- float
- double
- char
- boolean

(1.3) They are all ways to represent integer literal. The different is their size, thus
their range of value.

(1.4) 300. 0x12C is the hexadecimal value for 300.

(1.5) Output: x = 300 (12C hex)
%d is the specifier for integer in Java formatting while %X is the specifier for hexadecimal formatting

(1.6) incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from int to byte
It is an error because 300 is out of byte's value range, causing a "lossy conversion"

(1.7) System.out.format("y = %d (%X hex) \n", y, y) -----> y = 44 (2C hex). Value of y
is 44 as byte variable only has maximum 8 bit to represent number, thus, 300 (12C) in binary is truncated
to just 2C (remove first 4 bit, aka 1 left most in hexadecimal)

(1.8) It shows an error as %d is not the specifier for character type.

(1.9) x = 110 (6E hex)
This number is the ascii code for 'n'

(1.10) float and double variable both can be used for floating point number. The difference
is their ranges, specifically double has longer range.

(1.11) It returns false. The == checks equality.

(1.12) It returns true because y has been changed into int, therefore, the decimal part is truncated.

(1.13) true/false

(1.14) No. "" only represents string literal.

(1.15) String is not a primitive type in java. String is an object instead.

(1.16) scope of a variable is the span/space/code block where the variable exists and is not terminated.
A code block is the group of one or multiple lines of code. Code block is created between the opening and closing
curly brackets.
